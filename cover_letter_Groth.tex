My co-authors and I would like to submit the attached manuscript to be 
considered for publication in the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America. 
In this paper we present an effective strategy for accelerating the computation
of nonlinear acoustic fields generated in high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) 
applications. The approach presented is appropriate for time-harmonic and weakly 
nonlinear fields, as it uses these properties to decompose the field into the separate harmonic contributions and 
compute them on meshes tailored to each harmonic. As the higher harmonics are 
localised around the focus of the HIFU beam, these meshes can be contracted, 
leading to a large reduction in computational cost. We study the extent to which 
these meshes can be contracted by employing a computation technique based on 
volume potentials. We believe the techniques and results presented in this work 
have the potential to improve the efficiency of many numerical schemes used
in HIFU simulations and, as such, will be of interest to the HIFU modelling and 
nonlinear acoustics communities.

For referees, we believe that all of the following have interests and expertise 
that would align well with the topics of this submission:

David Sinden, Fraunhofer MEVIS, Germany \\
Jon Trevelyan, University of Durham, United Kingdom \\
Jonathan Hargreaves, University of Salford, United Kingdom \\
Ivan Graham, University of Bath, United Kingdom \\
